<h1>Joep Duin</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Joep Duin and I’m 16 years old. I recently graduated with my HAVO diploma from Bonhoeffer College in Castricum, where I followed the NT/NG profile with Research & Design (O&O). I’m really interested in programming, which is why I’ll be studying Computer Science at Inholland in Haarlem starting this September.</p>
